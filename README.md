Hi there,

I'm Daria Savchenko and this is my test task for CHI Software.

You can view my test task at the following URL: http://vps59047.hyperhost.name/

In this project, a table was implemented to display various data about cars, along with CRUD functionality, pagination,
search, filtering, and data persistence between page refreshes. React and the Material React Table library 
(https://www.material-react-table.com/) were used to implement this functionality.

The decision to use the library was made after careful consideration of the advantages it provides:

1. Time and effort-saving: Using a library like Material React Table significantly speeds up development by providing 
ready-made solutions for common tasks. It reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and simplifies its 
maintenance and evolution. Instead of spending time and effort on implementing every function or component from scratch, 
developers can leverage pre-built components from the library, saving both time and effort.

2. Improved code quality and safety: Popular libraries undergo thorough testing and are used by numerous developers. 
This contributes to better code quality and ensures security. Libraries also adhere to best development practices, 
helping to improve code structure and style.

3. Rich functionality and customizability: Libraries, especially popular ones, typically offer a wide range of ready-made
components and functions. They provide powerful capabilities that can be utilized in a project and offer customizable 
parameters to adapt them to specific requirements.

4. Community support: Using a popular library provides access to an active community of developers, where help can be 
found, questions can be asked, experiences can be shared, and solutions to complex problems can be found. This 
accelerates development and ensures long-term support.

By using the Material React Table library in this project, the development of the car data table functionality was 
significantly simplified and accelerated, while ensuring high code quality and a wealth of ready-made features for 
customization and extension.

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
cd repository

3. Run the setup script:
bash setup.sh
